# Differences from the Base Game

Due to ToS:A being played through Discord, there exist some changes from the base game experience beyond just custom roles and modifiers. First and foremost, all games are run by hosts. A game’s host is in charge of managing when phases start and end, monitoring player activity, and most importantly, determining the results of players’ actions. For a player to use an ability, create a will, or create a death note, they must send a direct message to the host detailing what they wish to do. Because the results of players’ actions are determined manually, before the end of each night, there will be a period of downtime which the host will spend processing the night’s results, after which players will receive their results, or “You had a quiet night.” if they would receive no other results. To compensate for this, all phases are extended to be significantly longer than they are in the base game. In practice, this means that a standard game of ToS:A will usually take two to three hours, whilst games with more experimental mechanics will likely take longer.

In the interest of avoiding deaths by disconnects, if a player is unresponsive, the game’s host may attempt to find a replacement player. If successful, the replacement player will take the original player’s role and position in the town, and the host will share with them any information the original player had. If the player remains unresponsive, and no replacements are found, then the player will die to a disconnect.

## Whisper Bot

Finally, ToS:A makes use of a custom bot called Whisper Bot to manage certain functions that are difficult for a host to replicate on their own, such as whispering, voting, and other role-specific mechanics. Players can use the following commands during a game:

`/whisper <Target player’s name or position> <Message to whisper>`- Used during the day while alive to whisper to an alive player.

`/vote <Target player’s name or position>` - Used during the voting subphase while alive to vote for an alive player.

`/guilty`, `/innocent`, and `/abstain` - Used during the judgement subphase while alive to vote guilty, vote innocent, or abstain respectively.

`/jailcell <Message to send>` - Used at night as a Jailor to speak to the player you jailed, or to speak to the Jailor that jailed you.

`/listplayers` - Used at any point to receive a copy of the player list, showing which players are alive.
