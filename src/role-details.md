# Role Details

At the beginning of every game, all players will receive a role, which will determine what their goal is within the game, and what actions they can perform to help themselves achieve that goal. The following are some key aspects to note when looking at a role’s description.

## Faction

ToS:A currently has six factions: **Town**, **Coven**, **Corporate**, **Spirits**, **Elementals**, and **Neutral**. With the exception of **Neutral**, roles of the same faction are teammates, and must work together to kill opposing factions.

## Alignment

Describes what a role’s function is within its faction. Examples of alignments include **Town Support**, **Coven Deception**, and **Neutral Evil**.

## Ability

Allows a role to actively interact with the game in unique ways beyond just speaking and voting.

### Restrictions

Almost all abilities have restrictions on when they can be used. Most are only limited in what phase they can be used, however some abilities have further restrictions.

### Charges

Some abilities can only be used a limited amount of times each game.

### Targeting

Whenever a player chooses to use an ability on another player, it is considered to target that player.

### Visiting

Whenever a player targets another player with a night ability, they will visit that player unless stated otherwise. Some day abilities will also result in a visit the following night.

### Rampaging

The attack will be dealt to the target, as well as any other players who visit them.

## Attribute

Passive effects that do not require the player’s input. A common example is immunities, which protect a role from certain effects.

## Attack and Defence

Determines who a role can kill, and who a role can be killed by, respectively. In order from weakest to strongest, the stages of attack are none, basic, powerful, and unstoppable, and the stages of defence are none, basic, powerful, and invincible. For an attack to kill a player, its power must be greater than the player’s defence. Note that a role’s listed attack and defence are only indicators, and some roles are able to deal attacks at a stage different to their listed attack, or grant themselves defence at a stage different to their listed defence.

## Uniqueness

If a role is tagged as unique, it means only one alive player can have that role at a time. Some roles are mutually unique, meaning they cannot appear together.

## Vanilla/Custom

Indicates whether a role is from the base game, or one added by ToS:A.

## Win Condition

Shows what conditions need to be fulfilled for a role to win. For most roles, this means killing any other roles who oppose them, however some **Neutral** roles have to fulfil other conditions to win.
