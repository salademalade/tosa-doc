# Deaths

When a player is attacked, if the attack being dealt to them is greater than their current defence, they will die. After a player dies, the town will be notified that they have died, be told how they died, be shown their will, be shown their killer’s death note if they were killed by a player with a death note, and learn their role. Players cannot speak while a death is being announced, but may whisper. All roles may write a will, and most roles capable of attacking other players may write a death note.

Once a player is dead, they cannot speak in the game’s #main-match channel, and instead gain access to a channel where dead players can speak with each other. Dead players cannot vote or be voted, and are not counted when determining the number of votes required to put a player on trial. Players cannot use their abilities once they have died unless otherwise specified.
