# Phases

A game of ToS:A is composed of multiple phases. Depending on the current phase, players may speak in various chats, roles may use their abilities, and players may be given the opportunity to vote. Every game begins on day 1, which is then followed by night 1, then day 2, then night 2, and so on.

## Day

During the day, alive players may openly speak with each other in the game’s #main-match channel, and from day 2 onwards, may vote to hang other players. Additionally, alive players may whisper to each other at any point during the day. Most roles cannot use their abilities during the day, but some can, and some will take effect immediately upon being used, unlike most other abilities. The day phase can be split up into the following five subphases:

### Discussion

Alive players may speak to each other. Once the discussion subphase ends, if it is not day 1, the voting subphase will begin. Otherwise, the night phase will begin.

### Voting

Alive players may speak to each other, and may vote to put each other on trial. The number of votes required to put a player on trial is equal to the number of alive players divided by two, plus one, rounded down. If a player receives enough votes, they will be put on trial, and the defence subphase will begin. Once the voting subphase ends, the curfew subphase will begin.

### Defence

Only the player on trial may speak. Once the defence subphase ends, the judgement subphase will begin.

### Judgement

Alive players may speak to each other, and those not on trial may vote on if the player on trial is **guilty** or **innocent**. Alive players not on trial who do not vote will **abstain**. Once the judgement subphase ends, if the player on trial received more **guilty** votes than **innocent** votes, the last words subphase will begin. Otherwise, the voting subphase will continue, unless it is the third time the judgement subphase has occurred that day, in which case the curfew subphase will begin.

### Last Words

Only the player on trial may speak. Once the last words subphase ends, the player on trial will die, and the curfew subphase will begin.

### Curfew

Alive players may speak to each other. Once the curfew subphase ends, the night phase will begin.

## Night

At night, alive players may speak in any faction chats they have access to. Most roles’ abilities can be used at night, and some day abilities used the previous day will take effect at night. The night phase doesn’t have subphases, as all points in the night are mostly identical.
